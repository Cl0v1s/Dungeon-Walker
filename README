Dungeon Walker will be a free, open-source,multiplayer RogueLike coded in javascript with Html5 and playable on a web browser.

Why ?
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Recently, I discovered the roguelike games and instantly, I liked the liberty and the difficulty who offer these games.
So, I decided to create my own RogueLike.
I choosed the Html5/javascript for learn the oriented object javascript and for discover the new possibilities of the Html5.


ok.So where is the originality ?
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The RogueLikes use traditionaly text-characters to represent the world on the screen.
This technic allow the programmer to develop the gameplay and the in-game possibilities because he does not have to 
create a graphic theme for his project.
In Dungeon Walker, I would offer maximum possibilities and liberty to the players.
And I think the exploration of an infinite dungeon online can be very interesting and be a good experience for the gamers.

Where I can try it ?
